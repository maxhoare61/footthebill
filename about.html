            <p>At Downstream, we believe public data should be truly public.<br>
                <br>
                However, important insights often sit buried in fragmented government databases and publications.
                Whilst the information is publicly available, extracting meaningful insights requires technical expertise, time,
                and resources.<br>
                <br>
                This creates a gap between public information and public understanding.<br>
                Public data is only truly transparent when its insights are accessible to everyone - not just data scientists.<br>
                <br>
                That’s why at Downstream, we do the heavy lifting. We clean, investigate, and transform raw government data into
                engaging, interactive stories that invite exploration and understanding. We connect scattered datasets,
                highlight hidden patterns, and present information in ways that help you understand the full picture. From
                tracking political influence through donation patterns to putting carbon emissions in perspective, we make
                important data accessible to everyone.<br>
                <br>
                That's why we're Downstream—delivering insights from public data, to the public.</p>
